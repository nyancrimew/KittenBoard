/**
 * Service that handles background tasks for the dictionary provider.
 *
 * This service provides the context for the long-running operations done by the
 * dictionary provider. Those include:
 * - Checking for the last update date and scheduling the next update. This runs every
 *   day around midnight, upon reception of the DATE_CHANGED_INTENT_ACTION broadcast.
 *   Every four days, it schedules an update of the metadata with the alarm manager.
 * - Issuing the order to update the metadata. This runs every four days, between 0 and
 *   6, upon reception of the UPDATE_NOW_INTENT_ACTION broadcast sent by the alarm manager
 *   as a result of the above action.
 * - Handling a download that just ended. These come in two flavors:
 *   - Metadata is finished downloading. We should check whether there are new dictionaries
 *     available, and download those that we need that have new versions.
 *   - A dictionary file finished downloading. We should put the file ready for a client IME
 *     to access, and mark the current state as such.
